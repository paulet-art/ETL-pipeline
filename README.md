**Customer Transactions ETL Pipeline**

This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to extract customer transaction data from various sources, clean and transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes Python for data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks, and Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration. The pipeline is designed to handle data from APIs, CSV files, and relational databases, ensuring data integrity and consistency for further analysis and reporting.
